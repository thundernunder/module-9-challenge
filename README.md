  ## Description 
  This Challenge gives me the opportunity to refactor previous code in order to build a terminal-based README generator. The primiary vehicle behind the functionality of this project is Node.js. The user will see the ability to utilize Node into a fully-functioning README generator, including the use of package installations. This README generator allows the user the ability to quickly create a high-quality README for all of their projects and applications.

  ## Installation 
  Make sure to have GitBash, Node.js, and VSCode installed for sucess

  ## Useage
  The user launches the application by inputting the commage 'node index.js' into the command line. Then the user is guided through the generation process by a series of prompts. Once the user answers all the prompts, a README.md file is saved in the root folder.

  ## Contributing
  Adding guidelines for contributions is always a good idea. This allows other coders to help improve upon your project and make it easier to use for the world at large.

  ## Test
  Testing is always important. Make sure you pass all your functionality tests before writing program code.
