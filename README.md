ðŸ‘¦ Nathan Underwood - Module 9 Challenge - README Generator

DESCRIPTION 
This Challenge gives me the opportunity to refactor previous code in order to build a terminal-based README generator. The primiary vehicle behind the functionality of this project is Node.js. The user will see the ability to utilize Node into a fully-functioning README generator, including the use of package installations. This README generator allows the user the ability to quickly create a high-quality README for all of their projects and applications. 

USEAGE
The user launches the application by inputting the commage 'node index.js' into the command line. Then the user is guided through the generation process by a series of prompts. Once the user answers all the prompts, a README.md file is saved, in this case to to 'utils' directory. 

FUNCTIONALITY
ðŸ“¼ Here is a short video of what the functioning webpage should look like:
